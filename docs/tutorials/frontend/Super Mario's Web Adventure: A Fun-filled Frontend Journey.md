## How Will Our Adventure Unfold?

Imagine you're Mario, starting at the beginning of World 1-1. Each lesson is like a new level, teaching you new skills and helping you overcome challenges. Here's a sneak peek at how our adventure will progress:

1. We'll start by building a simple webpage with just Mario and some ground.
2. Then, we'll add pipes, blocks, and enemies.
3. Next, we'll make Mario move and jump.
4. We'll add coins to collect and a score to keep track.
5. As we advance, we'll create multiple levels and add power-ups.
6. Finally, we'll have a complete Super Mario game that you created yourself!

Along the way, you'll learn not just how to make a game, but also how to think like a programmer. You'll solve puzzles, debug issues, and come up with creative solutions ‚Äì just like Mario overcoming obstacles in his adventures!

## What Do You Need to Start?

To begin this exciting journey, you'll need:

1. A computer (any kind will do ‚Äì PC, Mac, or even a Chromebook)
